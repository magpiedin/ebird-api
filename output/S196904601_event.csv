EBIRD,S196904601,P22,L152612,1.883,True,"11 species of warblers including 2 Black-throated Blues, but surprisingly few Nashville/Tennessee types today. And another obvious surge of Yellow-rumpeds and sparrows (WCSPs and WTSPs), with another batch of new arrivals for me at this patch (juvie Red-shouldered Hawk, Eastern Phoebes, Winter Wren, Hermit Thrush, and a couple of towhees).

Mild temperatures (67 to 68Â°), overcast with low cloud cover, misting off and on towards the end of the count, and moderate to strong winds from the northeast, especially in exposed areas.  But the interior of the sanctuary is surprisingly well buffered from the winds.",2024-09-29 11:49,1.201,EBIRD_iOS,3.1.8,CL23300,Cameron Rutt
